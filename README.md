# Snake Game
Simple Javascript Snake game, originally created by following the tutorial found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TcU2C1AACw&t=903s) on the [Learn Web Development](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8n8ftV94ZU_DJLOLtrpORA) Youtube channel.

## But wait, there's more!
Upon completion of the tutorial, I plan on adding the following enhancements:
- refactor code for better organization and readability (complete)
- ensure that the food does not spawn on the snake
- add ability to restart the game without refreshing the page
- add ability to choose difficulty level before staring the game
- probably more stuff, just can't think of anything right now...
